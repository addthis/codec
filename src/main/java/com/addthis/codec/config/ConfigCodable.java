/**
 * Note: This is only intended for unusual cases. Possibly debugging or classes that manipulate Config objects as a
 * core part of their functionality and need more than the raw ConfigValues that fields thusly typed would provide.
 *
 * The method defined here is called when an object is constructed from a Config or ConfigObject (even if it is derived
 * from a combination of a ConfigValue and syntax sugar from a pluggable type). In other words, unless this class
 * also implements {@link ValueCodable}, this method is guaranteed to be called before any fields are assigned.
 *
 * It gives implementors a chance to make any last minute changes or observations on its intended config -- or
 * to supplant the process altogether. If the implementor returns a non-null ConfigOject, construction will resume
 * as normal with the returned ConfigObject replacing the one that was passed in as a parameter. Otherwise, no
 * fields as assigned values by Codec. This differs from returning an empty object in at least three notable ways:
 *
 * 1. fields flagged as required are not checked
 * 2. default values are not used (the second parameter passed in - their behavior will otherwise be unchanged)
 * 3. codable fields in the super class will not be set, so make sure to initialize them in this method if needed
